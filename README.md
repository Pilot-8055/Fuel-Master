# Fuel-Master

Fuel Master is a fuel management addon for GeoFS that adds a layer of realism to your flights.  
It’s designed to be used with the **bookmarklet method only** — be sure to follow the steps below to get started smoothly.


## What Is Fuel Master?

**Fuel Master** helps bring your virtual flights closer to reality.  
It handles everything from planning your fuel load based on distance and speed, to monitoring real-time fuel burn during the flight — all from inside a sleek, easy-to-use cockpit panel. Whether you're flying short hops or long hauls, it's your go-to fuel buddy.


## How to Install

Getting started is simple:

1. Copy the full Fuel Master script.
2. Create a new bookmark in your browser.
3. Paste the script into the **URL** field of that bookmark.
4. Open [GeoFS](https://geo-fs.com) in your browser.
5. After your aircraft and scenery are fully loaded, click the bookmark.
6. You'll see **FUEL MASTER** appear just above the bottom toolbar. Then, you're ready to fly.


## How to Use It

1. Click the **FUEL MASTER** button to open the main control panel.
2. Head to the **Planner Tab** to enter your flight distance and cruise speed — Fuel Master will calculate how much fuel you need.
3. Use the **Refuel Tab** to top up your tanks while on the ground.
4. Keep an eye on the **HUD Bar**, which gives you a live readout of your fuel level mid-flight.
5. Explore tabs like **Details**, **Instructions**, and **More** for deeper control and features.
6. Want the HUD to stay up? Pin it, and it won’t disappear even if you toggle the main panel.
7. Done flying? Use the **Remove Addon** button in the **More** tab to cleanly disable everything.
